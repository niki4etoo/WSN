Wireless Sensor Network Simulator

The main focus of the app is to find a shortest path ( with Dijkstra Algorithm, Floyd Algorithm, A* and Bellman-Ford Algorithm ) in a wireless sensor network or networks. The user can create, select, move, edit and delete nodes placed in a grid. There is a starting node and ending node selected by the user and finding the shortest path between the choosen nodes.
